## The ORBIT Ecosystem

ORBIT is a specification for simple, fungible tokens implemented by utilizing OP_RETURN for the storage of token events on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. No changes to the Bitcoin Cash protocol or nodes are required. However, wallets may wish to incorporate this token standard in order to allow the user to easily take account of and interact with tokens that adhere to this ORBIT standard.
